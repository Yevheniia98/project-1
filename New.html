	 	<i>
	 	   The Derinkuyu underground city is an ancient multi-level underground city in the Derinkuyu district in Nevşehir Province, Turkey, extending to a depth of approximately 85 metres (279 ft). It is large enough to have sheltered as many as 20,000 people together with their livestock and food stores. It is the largest excavated underground city in Turkey and is one of several underground complexes found throughout Cappadocia.

	 	The underground city at Derinkuyu could be closed from the inside with large stone doors. Each floor could be closed off separately.The city could accommodate up to 20,000 people and had amenities found in other underground complexes across Cappadocia,such as wine and oil presses, stables, cellars, storage rooms, refectories, and chapels. Unique to the Derinkuyu complex and located on the second floor is a spacious room with a barrel-vaulted ceiling. It has been reported that this room was used as a religious school and the rooms to the left were studies.Starting between the third and fourth levels are a series of vertical staircases, which lead to a cruciform church on the lowest (fifth) level. The large 55-metre (180 ft) ventilation shaft appears to have been used as a well. The shaft provided water to both the villagers above and, if the outside world was not accessible, to those in hiding.

	<p>
		Caves might have been built initially in the soft volcanic rock of the Cappadocia region by the Phrygians in the 8th–7th centuries BC, according to the Turkish Department of Culture.When the Phrygian language died out in Roman times, replaced with its close relative[6] the Greek language, the inhabitants, now Christian, expanded their caverns to deep multiple-level structures adding the chapels and Greek inscriptions.<br>The city at Derinkuyu was fully formed in the Byzantine era, when it was heavily used as protection from Muslim Arabs during the Arab–Byzantine wars (780–1180 AD). The city was connected with other underground cities through many kilometers of tunnels. Some artifacts discovered in these underground settlements belong to the Middle Byzantine Period, between the 5th and the 10th centuries.
		These cities continued to be used by the Christian natives as protection from the Mongolian incursions of Timur in the 14th century.<br>

	    After the region fell to the Ottomans, the cities were used as refuges (Cappadocian Greek: καταφύγια) by the natives from the Turkish Muslim rulers.<br>

	    As late as the 20th century, the local population, Cappadocian Greeks, were still using the underground cities to escape periodic persecutions. For example, Richard MacGillivray Dawkins, a Cambridge linguist who conducted research from 1909 to 1911 on the Cappadocian Greek speaking natives in the area, recorded such an event as having occurred in 1909: "When the news came of the recent massacres at Adana, a great part of the population at Axo took refuge in these underground chambers, and for some nights did not venture to sleep above ground."<br>

	    In 1923, the Christian inhabitants of the region were expelled from Turkey and moved to Greece in the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, whereupon the tunnels were abandoned.

        In 1963, the tunnels were rediscovered after a resident of the area found a mysterious room behind a wall in his home while renovating. Further digging revealed access to the tunnel network.

         In 1969, the site was opened to visitors, with about half of the underground city currently accessible.

    	So far, as many as 36 dungeons have been discovered in Cappadocia, of which the Kaymakli underground city is relatively large, and the landforms here are all kinds of strange. The origin of the underground city Due to three large-scale volcanic eruptions, this area has formed a unique landform, and also brought a strange rock layer, which looks soft and can be digged with a shovel, but after digging and drying, it is Stronger than rock. This 40-meter-deep, eight-story underground city originated from the Hittites, and later increased in size. There are 8 floors in total, but only 5 floors are currently open. It is said that it could accommodate 10,000 people at that time. Squatting into the narrow-street underground city maintains a constant temperature of 13-16 degrees Celsius all year round, and you can bring a thin jacket when visiting. The entrance to the dungeon is very hidden. After entering the circling stone stairs, you enter a narrow passage that can only be passed by one person. The passage is wide and narrow, and most of the time, you can only move forward by bending over or squatting. A labyrinth of rooms connected to each other, spreading all the way to the depths of the earth. Traces of cave life Walking into the underground city is like entering a complex porous giant swiss cheese, with holes everywhere, many "windows" between rooms, and paths that go around and go up and down with several floors. . The dungeon is well-equipped, with traces of people's cave life everywhere, jars for oil, wine and water, sinks for squeezing grapes, communal kitchens blackened by soot, cowsheds, horse stables and deep incredible wells, except for the bedrooms. There are even schools and churches. Although there are several floors underground, the air is not as bad as expected. The ventilation designed by the underground city is still very good. The vertical ventilation holes are 70-80 meters deep. However, it is generally recommended for tourists to go down to the fourth floor and take pictures.

				Formation and Discovery
			</strong>
		</center>
	</p>

	<p>
		Several million years ago, volcanic eruptions spewed layer after layer of ash, called tuff or tufa. Over time the tuff cemented into a soft, easily carvable, yet relatively stable rock. Inhabitants of ancient Anatolia realized that they could carve out their homes right into the hillsides and underground. Derinkuyu is one of the many rock-cut dwellings in the region, however, it is the deepest one to date.<br> <br>

The discovery of the subterranean dwellings occurred in 1963 during the renovation of a surface home. When a wall caved in, an underground room that led to a subterranean passageway opened up. Upon exploration of the passageway, the workers realized that it led even further into a deep labyrinth. It was an astonishing find.

		Within the enormous eighteen levels of the city (only eight are accessible), researchers found kitchens, bedrooms, bathrooms, food storage rooms, oil and wine presses, wells, weapons storage areas, churches, schools, tombs, and domestic animal stables. There were rooms of varying sizes for different needs. Small spaces turned out to be rock-cut tombs, while large spaces provided the ideal rooms for community meetings and schools. It is evident that the people planned to be completely self-sufficient. More than fifty ventilation shafts brought in air from above, while thousands of smaller ducts distributed that air throughout the entire city.<br> <br>Some archaeologists believe that an 8-kilometer long passageway connects Derinkuyu to another amazing underground city in Kaymakli. This suggests that there was some degree of cooperation between the various civilizations of the Cappadocia region.

				What is the Age of Derinkuyu and Who Built It?
			</strong>
		</center>
	</p>

	<p>
		The age of Derinkuyu and who built it are uncertain. It is known that the Hittites dominated the Anatolia region from about 1600 BCE to about 1200 BCE. After this period, the Hittite Empire collapsed into smaller groups, possibly due to multiple invasions and wars. Subsequently, the Phrygians migrated to the area from the Balkans. Thus, if the Hittites built the dwelling, as a number of scholars believe, it may have been well before 1200 BCE.<br><br>Other experts theorize that the Phrygians built the subterranean city, which could have taken place between 1200 BCE and 800 BCE. Later, Persians, Macedonians (Alexander the Great), Greeks, Armenians, Syrians, and many other groups had a presence in Cappadocia. The earliest known mention in writing of underground cities in the Cappadocia kingdom came from a Greek historian-soldier named <mark>Xenophon</mark> in 370 BCE. Xenophon spent time and traveled throughout the region. In his work, Anabasis he says:<br><br>The houses here were underground, with a mouth like that of a well, but spacious below; and while entrances were tunnelled down for the beasts of burden, the human inhabitants descended by a ladder. In the houses were goats, sheep, cattle, fowls, and their young; and all the animals were reared and took their fodder there in the houses.

	<p>
		Its history lies down Ottoman Period from Rome (Byzantine) Era. At the beginning, the East Rome Time (between 15th and 16th centuries), this natural castle was used as a defence mechanism to prevent any attacks from the enemy. The people took advantage of it. Especially it was run as a warning system because whenever there was a problem the guards easily sent messages by using lights, mirrors from the castle. Afterwards due to its geopolitical position, it was a main control centre of trade way like Royal Road and Silk Road in the periods of Persian and Seljuk.

        In Ottoman Time, the castle was again a main location for protection and maintenance. Because of that, those times it was surrounded many homes. When it happened any attack from invasion of the enemy, the local people could effortlessly escape to the fortress to protect themselves.

		The castle has an amazing and breath-taking architectural style.There is a cave with three special ways, a huge joint hall and a guardian room. The road of the cave covered with the stones. Except for the cave, the castle contains the passages but some of them were filled with the rubbles. It also includes secret tunnels with honeycombed structure built by locals to hide themselves from the warriors. But those tunnels are very narrow which caused to be said many legends about it. One of those stories; once upon a time the dwarfs lived there and they established these tunnels according to their sizes.<br>Today, after the many renovations, the castle is illuminated with light of Led which is a perfect lightening system. When you look at it, you feel yourself in the magical place.

				GÖREME
		</center>
	</h2>

	<p>
		<i>
		Göreme is a village of around 2,000 people in Nevşehir province in Central Anatolia. It is well known for its fairy chimneys (Turkish: peribacalar), eroded rock formations, many of which were hollowed out in the Middle Ages to create houses, churches and underground cities. Göreme was formerly known as Korama, Matiana, Macan and Avcilar.<br>Göreme sits at the heart of a network of valleys filled with astonishing rock formations. It also has the most painted churches in Cappadocia. When the nearby Göreme Valley was designated to become the most important tourist centre for Cappadocia (Turkish: Kapadokya), the village's name was changed to Göreme for practical reasons. <br>Once an agricultural settlement, modern Göreme is best known for its flourishing tourism industry, in particular for its hot air balloon rides and many boutique hotels created out of old cave homes. The village sits within the Göreme National Park which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1985.
        The nearest airports are Nevşehir Kapadokya Airport and Kayseri Airport. The village is also served by long-distance buses from all over Turkey.

		</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
		Very little is known about Göreme's history until modern times in part because it was a small settlement away from the more travelled main roads linking Kayseri to Konya and the Mediterranean coast to Aksaray. The village contains several pillared tombs believed to date back to Roman times. In Byzantine times what is now Göreme was actually two separate but adjacent villages: Corama where the modern Open Air Museum can be found, and Matiana/Macan where the modern village is. The first written record of Matiana and Corama appears in the proceedings of the Council of Chalcedon in 451 which was attended by representatives of both the settlements. A Life oI St Hieron, the patron saint of Göreme, written in the sixth century nevertheless refers to events in the third century and offers the first mention of villagers living in cave houses. Some of the simpler cave churches around the village date from the sixth and seventh centuries, others from the tenth and eleventh centuries which is also when many of the frescoes were painted.<br><br>The single finest non-religious building in Göreme was constructed in 1796. It is usually referred to as the Mehmet Paşa Konağı (Mehmet Paşa Mansion) although the true name of the original owner is unknown. The walls of its selamlık (men's room) and haremlik (women's room) are completely covered with murals, those in the men's room featuring images of Constantinople mosques and landscapes, those in the women's room more domestic.<br>The first Westerner writer to leave an account - and drawing - of Göreme was the French archaeologist Charles Texier who passed through in the 1830s.In a book based on his travels in 1837 Sir William Hamilton referred to the chapel of St Hieron and the so-called Roma Kalesi (Roman Castle) in Göreme.

		The malleable nature of the rocks and cones in and around Göreme has meant that people have carved out cave homes here from at least the third century (and probably from long before). The earliest such homes were probably simple caves but by the 20th century most of the houses (except those in single cones) had stone rooms built in front of the caves for families to live in while the caves were relegated to stabling and storage. The houses were designed to suit a place-specific way of life, with mangers for the animals cut from the rock along with presses used to tread grapes and later to make pekmez (grape molasses). Tandır ovens cut into the floors doubled as heating. This was a way of life that continued right into the first decade of the 21st century but that came to an effective end as a result of a tourism book that saw almost all the old houses converted into boutique hotels by around 2015.

	</p>

	<p>
		Göreme was little visited by tourists until the 1970s but by 2000 had become the tourist capital of Cappadocia. Tourism brought wealth and a better standard of living to the village but it has completely changed not just the use of the old cave buildings within the village which have almost all been converted into hotels but also the lives of the villagers, almost all of whom now work in tourism.[10] Many erstwhile residents have moved to live in the surrounding towns and villages - Nevşehir, Avanos, Uçhisar and Ürgüp - having sold their houses in Göreme for conversion into hotels. In the second decade of the 21st century an increasing number of hotels started to be built or bought by investors from outside Göreme.
